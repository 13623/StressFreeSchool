Your stress level is ¡°Moderate¡± at the moment. 
Mate you should be having a bit of hard time. 
It is important that you acknowledge your stress, and seek for help from other people. 
The potential people range from your parents, significant other and friends. 
Now don¡¯t be embarrassed that you have moderate level of stress, because everyone has ups and downs in their lives. 
Important thing you should remember is that you should never rely on caffeine, alcohol or drugs. 
It may look like a simple solution; you don¡¯t feel stressed anymore when you are either drunk or high or drinking coffee, or potentially all at the same time. 
But this is not an ultimate solution, and you will likely be even more stressed out when you are sober. 
What you try and do is indulge yourself in some physical activity, like go out and play soccer or rugby with your mates, whatever you enjoy. 
Just about any form of physical activity can help relieve stress and burn away anger, tension and frustration. 
Don¡¯t be scared or embarrassed that you are getting a lot of stress. 
With the things i told you, you should be a normie in no time!
