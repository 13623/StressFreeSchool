Your stress level is ¡°High¡± at the moment. 
Uh.. I will be honest. 
This is not good. 
You are getting a lot of stress, wherever it may be from. 
So much that I have limits helping you over this bunch of text. 
You should seek help from therapy, and this is not a suggestion, you should do it. 
The best thing I can advise you is try identify what it is that is causing you this much of stress. 
Is it your boss who shouts at you like there¡¯s no tomorrow? 
Or is it your ahole and immature friend who says ¡°just a prank¡±? 
Whatever it may be, once you know what it is that is causing you so much stress, you may confront them, and tell them honestly how you feel. 
Hopefully you can make sense with them.
If it¡¯s not a social situation that is causing you stress, like maybe your life and where it¡¯s heading, remember that this sense of dissatisfaction is only momentary, and do what you think is right. 
I can promise you though that in a few years or even months, that this problem you are having right now will only be a small part of the past. 
Well, good luck and you da best music! 
Would you like to go to therapist webpage right now?
