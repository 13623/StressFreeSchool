Your stress level is low at the moment. 
While it is not especially threatening at this stage, it is possible that you are being stressed out by a bit.
But don¡¯t be stressed over this one though.
All you have to do is little things that would make your life smoother. 
Get a lot of sleep, as much as you can. 
This will help you relax in many stressful situations. 
Find the things you enjoy doing, and it can be as simple as having banter with your significant other or friend. 
Once you start doing these more and more, you will find yourself more controlled and less stressed out! 
Noice!
